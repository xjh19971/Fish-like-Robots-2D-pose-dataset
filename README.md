# Fish-like-Robots-Pose-Dataset
Fish-like-Robots-2D-Pose-Dataset is a dataset for robotic fish pose estimation from [Intelligent Biomimetic Design Laboratory (IBDLab)](http://en.ibdl.pku.edu.cn/) of Peking University.  There are 818 frames of random labeled images,
# Experimental Platform
The robotic fishes are designed to mimic the morphology and kinematics of carp. It consists of a rigid head, a flexible body and a caudal fin with a total length of 0.443m. Data is collected from a platform which consists of a 3x2 m pool and a vertically global view camera 3 m above. The dataset contains labeled images, labeled videos and unlabeled videos.
